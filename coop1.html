                        The CCS department is made up of several teams that work together to provide IT services for the

                    <h3>
                        Over the last 8 months, I was on the front lines of IT support for the University of Guelph,
                        helping clients such as staff, faculty, and student. Part of the week I was at the IT desk in
                        our library, where people could come visit us in person. Frequently, I had to help people with
                        problems singing in with their university login, software installations/troubleshooting, malware
                        protection, networking issues, slow computers and many other individual issues like helping
                        someone use a software or recovering documents.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        On the other days of the week I was at the Help Centre, troubleshooting technical issues
                        with
                        clients over the phone, on our online chat, and on an email ticketing system called
                        "Footprints".
                        Additionally to that I was communicating with internal teams such as
                        Managed
                        Desktops, Networking infrastructure, Info. Security, to escalate information on technical
                        issues
                        and incidents.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        Many of the skill I needed for the job such and clear communication, thinking on my feet and
                        troubleshooting had to be developed on the job because everyday was a new day with their own
                        challenges. Although, I had the opportunity to use my web development experience to do
                        project
                        work and update webpages used by our entire team to access links and document.

                    <h1>Goals & Skills</h1>
                    <h3>
                        Working at CCS was an amazing opportunity for me to grow and learn new skills that will benefit
                        me in future work experiences.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        My communication skills have improved so much over the past 8 months. When I first started
                        working, I was not at all confident working with clients and often wouldn’t know the right
                        questions to ask or ways to layout steps for troubleshooting. Though with experience and
                        learning from my mistakes I have become much more comfortable with interacting with clients,
                        following up with them to make sure their problem was solved, and escalating information to my
                        team members to help find solutions collaboratively.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        I also developed my teamwork and leadership skills while working within my team in CCS. Since
                        the experience I got was largely dependent on the types of issues I encountered, I learned to
                        collaborate with my team and share knowledge on how to troubleshoot specific issue and work
                        together to find solutions. Towards the end I even trained some of the new staff on procedures
                        and troubleshooting steps to take for issues that frequently came up.

                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        Problem solving was a big part of my job. Each client’s issues came with its own set of
                        challenges, over my work terms I developed my ability to quickly think on my feet and inquire
                        and analyze the situation. I did research on my own on how to troubleshoot common computer
                        issues that I was seeing often, and it gave me the tools and the confidence to solve more and
                        more complicated issues.
